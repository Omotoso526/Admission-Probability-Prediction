# Admission-Probability-Prediction

**Description**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the chances of admission for students based on various factors such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and more. The model is trained using Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision tree algorithms and aims to provide accurate predictions to assist students in evaluating their admission chances.

**Installation**

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

**Usage**

**Data Preprocessing:**

Load the data and perform preprocessing as required.

Handle missing values, if any, and encode categorical variables.

**Model Training:**

Train the model using the preprocessed data.

Save the trained model for future use.

**Prediction:**

Use the trained model to predict admission chances for new data.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The dataset contains the following columns:

GRE Score
TOEFL Score
University Rating
SOP (Statement of Purpose)
LOR (Letter of Recommendation)
CGPA (Cumulative GPA)
Research (Research Experience)
Chance of Admit (Target Variable)

**Training**

The model is trained using  Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision tree algorithms. 

**Evaluation**

The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others. The evaluation results are documented in the training notebook.
